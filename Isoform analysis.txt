"Isoform analysis" denotes the code crafted for generating categorical plots (cat plots) depicting isoforms that underwent switching between the two genotypes. The input for this analysis was derived from 'counts.tsv' files, which furnished Transcripts Per Million (TPM) values for each gene. By selecting the specific genes and isoforms of interest, the plots were generated using the provided code.
