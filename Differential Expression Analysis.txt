The codes labeled as "Transcript_dge" and "DGE" are utilized for the analysis of results obtained from differential expression analysis conducted using the edgeR tool. Both codes incorporate the generation of volcano plots, facilitating the identification of genes/isoforms that exhibit differential expression based on the threshold criteria of (|logFC| > 2.0 and FDR < 0.05). Additionally, these codes involve the construction of tables that calculate the 'Score' values essential for executing Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) through Webgestalt.

The 'DGE' code encompasses functionalities beyond those of 'Transcript_dge,' including a classification component for differentially expressed isoforms and genes. This classification is based on the type of RNA molecule or other characteristics to which they correspond.

In the case of 'Transcript_dge,' specific lines of code are dedicated to the identification of genes that undergo isoform switching. This identification process involves grouping transcripts by their respective genes and discerning whether a gene exhibits differentially expressed isoforms with distinct regulation directions (e.g., one isoform "Up regulated" and another "Down regulated"). This analysis is conducted not only on differentially expressed isoforms but also on all isoforms identified through edgeR.
