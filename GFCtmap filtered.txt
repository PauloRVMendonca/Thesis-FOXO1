The 'GFCtmap filtered' refers to the code utilized for analyzing entire GFFCompare output '.tmap' files without any pre-filtering. This code encompasses the generation of barplots, computation of p-values and effect sizes for each class, identification of significant classes, and the intersection of noteworthy outcomes from various analyses (including Vast-tools, differential expression of transcripts, and GFFCompare) with plotting of the Venn diagram. For GFFCompare results to be deemed relevant, transcripts must appear at least three times in each genotype, with classifications differing from those in control samples. If the classification of a transcript varies among samples within each genotype, the most probable classification determined by the most frequent appearance is considered [(line 20) of the code].
