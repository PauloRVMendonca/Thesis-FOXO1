The quantification of transcript numbers was conducted using the ".tmap" files obtained from GFFCompare for each sample. This quantification involved counting transcripts identified within the 23 pairs of chromosomes of the human genome, excluding transcripts labeled with the class "u" as they did not correspond to any specific chromosome. Transcripts were subjected to a filtering criterion, requiring each identified transcript to appear at least three times within each genotype ('Control' vs 'FOXO1 overexpression'), indicating its presence in all samples for that genotype. Subsequently, the quantified transcripts were categorized based on the type of RNA molecule associated with their respective genes.
