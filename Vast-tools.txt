"Vast-tools" is the code employed for analyzing the output '.tab' file generated by Vast-tools software. This code encompasses the identification of significant alternative splicing (AS) events, employing a threshold of (|dPSI| > 0.1 and |MV (0.95)| > 0.1). Furthermore, the code includes the generation of pie plots, aiding in the recognition of the type and quantity of events within the global set of identified significant AS events. Additionally, it facilitates the comparison of AS events' significance between control and FOXO1 overexpressing cells, highlighting events that are more significant in either condition.
